## Overview

Neural networks can be surprisingly well-approximated by linear models—but how do we measure that, and what does it mean?

This project introduces a simple, output-level diagnostic for regression networks: the **linearity score** \( \lambda(f) \), which quantifies how well a trained neural network can be mimicked by a linear model. Our findings highlight a key tension between **fidelity** and **predictive accuracy**, especially when interpreting neural networks as black boxes.

## What is λ(f)?

We define the linearity score λ(f) as the coefficient of determination ( R^2 ) between a trained neural network’s output ( f(x) ) and the best-fit linear approximation ( g(x) ). Formally:

[
\lambda(f) = R^2(f, g^*) = 1 - \frac{\mathbb{E}[(f(x) - g(x))^2]}{\text{Var}(f(x))}
]

This score reflects how linearly decodable the learned function is from input space—without requiring access to internal activations.
