This repository contains the code and datasets for the paper:

**Fidelity Isn’t Accuracy: When Linearly Decodable Functions Fail to Match the Ground Truth**

## Overview

Neural network outputs can often be well-approximated by linear models—but what does that tell us?

This project introduces the **linearity score** λ(f), a simple metric that quantifies how well a regression network’s predictions can be mimicked by a linear model. We show that this output-level diagnostic reveals important interpretability characteristics of learned functions—especially when **fidelity** (mimicking a network) diverges from **accuracy** (matching the ground truth).

## What is λ(f)?

Let \( f \) be a trained regression network, and let \( \mathcal{L} \) be the space of affine functions. Define:

\[
\lambda(f) := R^2(f, g^*) = 1 - \frac{\mathbb{E}[(f(x) - g^*(x))^2]}{\text{Var}(f(x))}
\]

where \( g^* = \arg\min_{g \in \mathcal{L}} \mathbb{E}[(f(x) - g(x))^2] \).

In other words, λ(f) measures how well a linear model can mimic the predictions of a trained neural network. Unlike typical \( R^2 \), this score is **not** about matching the ground truth—it’s about measuring how *linearly decodable* the function learned by the network is from the input space.

## Reproducing Results

All experiments and visualizations in the paper are contained in:

📓 [`lambda_linearity_score.ipynb`](./lambda_linearity_score.ipynb)

The notebook is fully self-contained and organized into:
- A reusable experimental framework
- Four datasets (synthetic + 3 real-world)
- Plots and tabulated results

To use λ(f) on your own data, modify the preprocessing and `build_network()` function and rerun the provided pipeline.
